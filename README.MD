The intent of this optimization project is to minimize distance traveled by technician while fulfilling as many jobs as possible in order to improve the number of case closed per day for a company that specializes in appliance repair and maintenance.

There are several contraints implemented in the model, such as technician total working hours per week and each job needs to be picked up by one technician only once. These contraints and objectives were translated into mathematical models and were later coded into Python using Gurobi Python API.

By implementing this optimized solution to San Diego's market, we're seeing an opportunity to improve closed orders per technician per day by 50%, lower gas costs by approximately $7,000, and these can be achieved with 25% few technicians. 

To run the script, you would need to request a Gurobi license either as commercial use or academic user.
